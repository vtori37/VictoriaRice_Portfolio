        <p>I have always had a deep appreciation for the art of storytelling, as I believe that storytelling can promote human togetherness and understanding. Whether it's through my own projects or collaborating with others, my goal is to aid in the cultivation of ideas and the creation of stories that utilize various mediums such as film, animation, video games, and digital media.
  
  I also value the importance of interpersonal skills and am a strong communicator. I am a quick learner and creative problem-solver, who is highly organized and takes initiative. Using these skills, I serve as a product manager at an e-commerce startup. My experience in this position has inspired me to pursue opportunities where I may leverage my degree in Business Administration in International Business to bridge communication between web development and product management. 
  
  I want to further enrich my knowledge of the world of gaming, film, animation, and digital media; therefore, I have a desire to learn more about technical design as well as web development. This includes my enrollment in UT-Austinâ€™s Coding Boot Camp, where I am in training to become a full-stack web developer. Currently, I am deepening my understanding of newly acquired skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, and MySQL. I plan to further broaden my knowledge of web development by learning TypeScript, Java, Python, and C#. In addition, I practice photography and my photo editing skills in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop in my spare time. 
  
  I am actively learning and look forward to new career opportunities, so please feel free to contact me if you believe I may be a good fit for your company.
