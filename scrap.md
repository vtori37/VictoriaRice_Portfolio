##  User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Deployed portfolio should include:
* header, a section for content, and a footer

### HEADER 
*  Presents developer name and navigation bar

### NAV BAR
*  About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume
*  The title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
*  Clicking on nav title brings me to  corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

### LOADING PORTFOLIO
*  the About Me title and section are selected as default for the site

### ABOUT ME
*  recent photo or avatar and author bio

### PORTFOLIO PAGE
*  titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository

### CONTACT SECTION
*  Should have a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
*  Moving cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text issues a notification that this field is required
*  Entering email address will issue notification that I have entered in an invalid email address

### RESEUME
*  Include a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

### FOOTER
*  Presents text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
